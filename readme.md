# Proc-Rock -  Procedural Generation of Rock Structures

## Building
The repository uses vcpkg to handle dependencies. Simply run `setup.bat` (Windows) or `setup.sh` (OSX / Linux) to clone the vcpkg repo and install the dependencies.

After running the setup script, it should be easily buildable with a simple cmake call.
